<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# Personal Project - Shuriken Shooter Game


This project is a 2D arcade-style video game developed using SpriteKit. Players shoot shurikens by tapping the screen, and the objective is to eliminate incoming monsters flying from the right side of the screen. The game is won by shooting a set number of monsters, while allowing any monsters to pass results in a loss. 

## Motivation & Process

I initially created this game by following a tutorial, which served as a great introduction to SpriteKit and its core concepts. While following it, I made a point to thoroughly document & fully understand everything I was doing. and after completing the tutorial, I continued to explore SpriteKit's capabilities by making adjustments and enhancements to the game, including haptics that play when you touch the screen, monsters that randomly change colors as they spawn, and sprites that I designed. 

In addition to teaching me some of the fundamentals of SpriteKit, commenting on and adjusting my code really helped me gain a deeper understanding of Swift and the process of designing & developing a game.

<!-- FUTURE GOALS -->
## Future Goals
* implement gameplaykit and use entities and components
* put ty in the game (boss mode)
* add a way to keep track of score and add a leaderboard (use game to learn how to manage data in swift)
